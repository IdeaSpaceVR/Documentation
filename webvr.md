# Virtual Reality Web / WebVR

WebVR is virtual reality on the web - using a web browser to access virtual reality spaces. IdeaSpace uses Mozilla's [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) framework for creating VR Themes. 

### Mobile: iOS, Android and Samsung GearVR

We recommend Google Cardboard v2-compatible headsets for best results. WebVR is available on Mobile Safari and Firefox for iOS, and Firefox for Android and Chrome for Android. At the time of writing, Samsung GearVR offers an experimental support for WebVR through the Samsung Internet for GearVR web browser.

### Desktop: Oculus Rift and HTC Vive

Desktop VR works on Windows PCs only. You have to install the latested Oculus runtime or Vive runtime software. Additionally you have to install [Firefox Nightly](http://mozvr.com/) or an experimental build of [Google Chrome](http://webvr.info/get-chrome/).
