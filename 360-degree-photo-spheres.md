# Publish 360-Degree Photo Spheres

Make sure you are familiar with [creating new spaces on IdeaSpace](/documentation/{{version}}/getting-started).

Create a new space and select the Web VR Photo Sphere Viewer theme. Then enter the title and a URL path for your space.

Upload your equirectangular photos. This theme is automatically resizing your photos in order to fit the photo sphere ("power of two" size). Additionally thumbnail images are generated which are being used for the photo sphere navigation menu. Save as a draft or publish your space immediately.

If you upload more than 3 photos, the navigation menu will show up. You can access the navigation menu by pressing the button on your Google Cardboard v2 (mobile) or by pressing the space bar on your keyboard on a Windows PC connected to an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.

### Information on Equirectangular Photos

All photos must have a 2:1 proportion / aspect ratio (e.g. 4096 x 2048). Only mono images are currently supported by this theme. 

The simplest way to produce equirectangular photos is either by using the Android Camera app on your mobile phone (choose Photo Sphere from the menu), or by using a device like the Rico Theta.   

Have a look at this [Equirectangular Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/) for examples.
