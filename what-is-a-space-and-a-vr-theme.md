### What is a Space?

A space is a virtual reality (WebVR) scene which can be either viewed on a screen with your web browser or with a head mounted display in 3D. A space viewed on a screen can be shown in full-screen as well as embedded as part of a webpage.

### What is a VR Theme?

A theme is a software package which defines what is shown in a virtual reality space and which type of content can be added. Types of content can be: images, text, etc. If you know Wordpress or other content management software then you are already familiar with the concept of themes.

An example: 

A theme could be a virtual reality photo gallery. In order to view photos in your head mounted display you have to upload your photos and give them text titles. You can exchange and remove photos any time and your space which is using this theme always reflects your changes.
